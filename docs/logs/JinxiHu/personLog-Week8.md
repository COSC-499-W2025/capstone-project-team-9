PR: [Display error message on the UI, Inform the user of the error type #29](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-9/pull/79)

The main purpose of this issue is to allow users to better understand the situation by displaying detailed information on whether the file upload is successful or not on the current UI interface.
I implement this feature by adding class to store feedback information from each file upload operation, allowing users to more directly understand whether the file upload was successful or any errors.
I also rewrote some of the codes in main.py and upload_file.py to accommodate this change.
