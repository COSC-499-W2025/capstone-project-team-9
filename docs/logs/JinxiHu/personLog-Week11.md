[issue#132: develop basic login and logout feature](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-9/pull/138)
- Developed user_manager.py file, which use a class to manage and do all account operations, currently has loging, logout and registration.
- At the same time, user_manager.py file could also store the current login account information locally.
- Developed user_menus.py file and modify the main_menus.py to  add an user menus to the system, which displays the current user and allows users to log in, log out, and register an account.
- This user menus would be extened as future more account system's functions be developed.
- The issue 132 current effect the menus and user data table only, the account system has not yet been linked with other systems.
