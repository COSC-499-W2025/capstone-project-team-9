# Week 6 Personal Logs

![image](/docs/logs/RyanEveson/Images/week6Log.png)

### This Sprints Progress
- This week we begun coding. I worked specifically on setting up the database to have the correct tables we need for testing, and wrote a simple python script that is able to ask the user if they want to add a folder or file to the database.
- Once the user responds (y/n), they will input the file that they want, and then it will be stored in the database.
- this script will only allow zip folders to be added, and they must be real files on the users device
- Worked on the github issues with Evan to create subissues for the milestone 1 requirements. these are not yet completed. there are still 10 more functionalities that we need to complete
