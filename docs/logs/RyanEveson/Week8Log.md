![image](/docs/logs/RyanEveson/Images/Week8Log.png)

### This Sprints Progress
- This is my PR Description: This pr is a extension of the upload files functionality. It encompasses the sub task of storing all the file contents in a new database. This database is called file_contents and contains all the needed information about the file that is being Stored. It stores information about the extension type, the lines of code, the folder its from etc. this function runs in unison with the upload files function that Sami completed last week. When you store the data.

- This completed issue #76
- Along with this I Updated the Issues board and build a document that is shared with everyone so that we are able to more easily track what we are going to work on over the next 2 weeks. This is done by adding your name to features and writing down a description so that there is less overlap of code. it is very similar to our project table that we have in github but it allows for us to explain our processes in more detail
### My plan for the next weeks and steps i am taking
- Ryan Will be working on Ranking and summarize ranking over the next 2 weeks. I am going to work on this by using Kevin And Erics PRs that they made this week and the metrics that they created to deteremine the best project and output the top ranked projects.
- plan for rank importance: There is a ranking score that is given by Eric’s code. With Kevin’s metrics that he pulled, and the score that Eric gets, i will create a weighted avg of all projects and rank them.
- Plan for summarize top projects:I will just summarize the summary of the top 3 projects using samis Summarizing logic. This should be a small PR and i will be able to help anyone who needs help
- This will just be added to the main.py and will allow the user to get a summary of the top 3 projects. It will not show any information about any other projects.
