**Weekly Goals Recap**

This week, our team created a first draft of the **functional and non-functional requirements** for our project.  
We discussed and refined ideas about what our system should accomplish and how it should behave under different conditions.  
Afterwards, we exchanged ideas with other groups during class discussions, which helped us **clarify key requirements** and **expand our understanding** of the project’s overall scope.

I participated in defining the requirements for the backend process and helped the team write clearer descriptions for user interactions.

**Weekly Goals Recap**

This week, our team focused on producing a **System Architecture Diagram** that represented the high-level structure of our project.  
We collaborated to identify the major components and their relationships, then presented our initial version for peer feedback.

Using the feedback received, we refined our architecture to improve **data flow clarity** and **system modularity**.  
I also helped draft part of the **project proposal document**, describing the **system scope**, **key features**, and **test case planning**.

**Weekly Goals Recap**

This week, our team developed **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)** for **Level 0** and **Level 1** to better illustrate how information moves through our system.  
I worked mainly with **Jinxi** and **Kevin** to design the **Level 0 DFD**, ensuring that the main processes, data stores, and external entities were clearly and logically connected.
