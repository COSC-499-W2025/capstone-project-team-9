# **What I Did This Week (2025/10/13 to 2025/10/19 week 7)**

## **Issue #38: Implemented Conditional Logic for External Service Routing**

### **In Simple Terms**
You built a system that checks whether users want to use external services (like ChatGPT or other LLMs) before sending their data out.  
If they say **no**, the system automatically uses **local analysis** instead.

---

### **What I Created**

- **AnalysisRouter** – The "traffic cop" that decides: *“Should we use external help or stay local?”*  
- **ExternalServicePermission** – Checks if the user has granted permission  
- **ServiceConfig** – Stores the user's choice in the database  
- **Database Table:** `external_service_permissions` – Remembers each user's preferences  
- **8 Unit Tests** – Ensure routing and permissions logic work correctly

### **By The Numbers**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lines of Code | ~350 (manageable PR size) |
| New Tests | 8 (all passing) |
| New Modules | 2 (`analysis/`, `external_services/`) |
| New Database Table | 1 (`external_service_permissions`) |
